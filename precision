precision

first number is the width/spaces, second number is the amount of chars to show, other than '+' and '-' and the second number's empty chars are 0's for ints/digits

for strings the second number is the number up to the index of the result string to print, and the first number is the width ////////intlen/charlen

if the first number is less than the width, forget the first number

if intlen > the amount of the second number, forget the second number

print out the number after a . amount of chars/digits, and then print the rest with spaces
